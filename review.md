1) Didn't you make it to complicated?
Is it really  (noodzakelijk) to use such complicated code to select the right items 
for the future days.

2) It's 3/4 of the code and most I understand. But from line 136 (I think)
you repeat some stuff. And i wonder why?

3) Did you all invented (zelf bedacht) it yourself?
